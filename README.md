# Simon Says Game

## Project Description

This is a classic **Simon Says** memory game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game displays a sequence of colored buttons, and the player has to repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the same order. The sequence gets longer with each level, and the game ends when the player makes a mistake.

## Deployment

You can play the game directly from the web via GitHub Pages. After pushing the project to your GitHub repository, enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay:** Press any key to start the game and follow the color sequence.
- **Level Progression:** As the player correctly repeats the sequence, the game advances to higher levels with increasingly longer sequences.
- **Game Over:** The game ends when the player makes a mistake, and the current score (level) is displayed.
- **High Score Tracking:** The highest score is tracked and displayed after each game.
- **Button Flashing Effect:** The buttons flash briefly when it's their turn in the sequence.
